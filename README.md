#Forecasting Inflation in Turkey using LSTM Networks and ARIMA Model
This project aims to forecast inflation in Turkey using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The dataset is obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute, Federal Reserve Economic Data, and World Bank data. The performance of the LSTM network and ARIMA model will be compared to determine which model is more accurate for forecasting inflation in Turkey.

How to Run the Code
The code for the project is arranged in a single Python file, forecasting_inflation.py. This file contains all the necessary functions and scripts for preprocessing the data, building and training the LSTM network and ARIMA model, and evaluating the performance of the models.

To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries
Open the Project_DL.py file in your favorite Python editor.
Modify the hyperparameters and settings as desired.
Run the script using python Project_DL.py.
The script will preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, build and train the LSTM network and ARIMA model, and evaluate the performance of the models. The results will be displayed in the console.
